# Blogfolio Astro


[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/jamescardona11/blogfolio-astro)
    

This template is perfect for those who want to use Tailwind CSS and Astro to build a blog. 

It is inspired by many other blogs (see the references bottom of this page), and I started this repository using [Tailwind Astro Starter Project](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Extend / Customize

`site-metadata.ts` contains a list of constants that you can customize to your liking, including the blog title, description, author, social media links, etc.

`src/lib/providers.config.ts` contains the default data provider configuration; this means where the source of data comes from.

`src/lib/data/local` contains a list of functions and maps to retrieve local information.

`src/lib/data/remote` contains the functions to retrieve information from notion and other remote sources.

`src/lib/data/..-provider.ts` each file represents how the information interacts with the app.

`.env.example` rename to .env and add the environment variables

Change the default view between list and grid; search `SwapViewButtons.astro` for blog or project and set the default view as param.


### Providers configuration

The file `src/lib/providers.config.ts` contains the configuration for providers; if you open a provider file inside `src/lib/data` you can see all providers can fetch data from local or remote you only need to change the configuration for notion or local and everything should be work as the template expected.

After deciding what configuration you want; feel free to delete the other code that is not used

**Current configuration:**
```
export const providersConfig: Provider = {
  resume: 'notion',
  about me: 'local',
  uses: 'notion',
  projects: 'notion',
  blog: 'local'
}
```



### Notion CMS configuration

1- Clone the notion template here: [Notion Template](https://jamescardona11.notion.site/Blogfolio-astro-template-4e95a6ec9dad4f6b9b3ccbe1355d6805)

2- Create a Notion Api; follow the official guide here: [API Setup](https://developers.notion.com/)

3- Choose what pages/databases will fetch information from the notion and set `.env`

4- Change `src/lib/providers.config.ts` configuration for `'notion'`
